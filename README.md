#Barcelona Travel Free

###Site Overview

Barcelona Travel Free is a travel company and is a site that hopes to help backpackers visiting Barcelona with activities that are suited to this particular type of traveller. The site is targeted at backpackers or other travellers that enjoy unconventional types of tours when visiting a different city around the world. This site is targeted towards this demographic as it enables them to socialise with like minded people while seeing different parts of the city and Cataluyna too.

###Header Element

I wanted something similar but eye-catching and I used the images that I did as they encompass the company’s belief of being for backpackers and also, that, by using the flags merged together, symbolising that Cataluyna is different but still joined together with Spain.
